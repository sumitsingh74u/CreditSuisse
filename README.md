## CreditSuisse Coding Assignment
### Pre Requisites
In order to run this program you will need to first have Java 1.8 installed on your machine and have previously set up 
gradle so that you can use the gradle command.

You can check for these requirements by using the commands:

```gradle -v```

```java -version```

If they are not already installed please go to the [link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/gradle/gradle_installation.htm) 
and follow the instructions to setup Gradle in order to run this program.

### Running The Program
In order to run the code you will need to either clone the repository locally or you can download the zip file into 
whichever directory you prefer and UnZip it.


After this you simply need to cd into **<Chosen Directory>**/CreditSuisse and run the command 
```gradle run --args='logfile.txt'``` which will build and run the program with the log file to be parsed being 
**logfile.txt** which is a sample file I created based on the example given in the assignment.

In order to run with a different logfile you just need to move the log file into the CreditSuisse directory and replace 
**logfile.txt** with the new file name in the aforementioned command or give a relative path to the logfile that you 
would like to be parsed.

Logging output from the program can be found in Logs.txt

### Notes
* I was unsure as to how the program should deal with displaying the database values back to you for evaluation as in
 the description of what the program should do it just says to "Flag any long events that take longer than 4ms and Write
 the found event details to file-based HSQLDB in the working folder. So I implemented a ```SELECT * FROM Events``` 
 statement which reads all table entries and logs the alerts in debug mode. As well as this I also added a 
 ```DELETE FROM Events``` method to clear the table before closing the connection as to avoid overlap of different files.

* Since I am using log4j for logging I went ahead and assumed that the **log4j.properties** file in **main/resources** 
would set the logging mode automatically based on the server, i.e. Test would be DEBUG etc.

* I added some sample tests to the program but I didn't have the time to fully finish all of them.

* I have implemented the code in such a way that all errors from below are bubbled up to the top level and logged there,
in practice I would have set up a global error handler for handling errors but as time was short I decided that would be
the quickest implementation.
